# Sending mail

The Basebox comes with [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/Mailhog/), which catches mails that are being sent via
the system's sendmail. Mailhog can be found on HTTP port 8025 by browsing to `http://your.project.box:8025`,
and will show an overview of the sent mails.

Releasing the mail, thus delivering it for real, can be done as follows:

1. Click on the mail you want to release
2. In the mail detail page, click on the release button in the top bar
